                    <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in
                        1991.

                    Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
                    Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.

                        Learn how to make python programming with free online classes that will teach you the
                        fundamentals with LearningOnline. Develop simple programs in python making use of conditionals,
                        loops, and recursion
                        Understand basic mechanisms of the OOP paradigm, as well as use the API of some of the most
                        common python classes Detect and correct common programming errors at compile time and runtime
                        Compare the efficiency of programs in terms of resources used Model simple programs using basic
                        software engineering techniques.
                        Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other
                        programming languages.
                        Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is
                        written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
                        Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way. The
                        most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial.
                        However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is
                        still quite popular.
                        In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an
                        Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are
                        particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.

                        test-writers, so many projects you get will have decent test suites. This makes refactoring and
